  <h1>Escaropen</h1>
    <a>Escaropen is a neato service that makes versions of Skype work, maybe more in the future too! Coming soon!</a>
    <!--<a>Escaropen is a recent service designed make old versions of Skype, and potentially more (Windows Live Messenger?).</a>-->

    <h1>But why?</h1>
    <a>Fuck Microsoft, go back to Skype. Simple.</a>
    <!--<main>Why not? MSN messenger was once Microsoft's main messaging service and social network platform before all the social media platforms like Discord, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or twitter. After Microsoft bought Skype in 2012 and though owning two seperate chat services was redundant, they shutdown MSN messenger despite its popularity.</main>
    <p>So, why not restore something that helps people communicate, meet new people and just have fun?</p>-->

    <h1>But how?</h1>
    <a>We (the Escaropen team) are working on a replacement service for the now-shutdown Skype. Soon Windows Live Messenger and more may be supported.</a>
    <!--<main>With the help of the Escargot source-code (which isn't being updated anymore and now is closed-source), we (the Escaropen team) are working on a replacement service for the now-shutdown MSN Messenger and Windows Live Messenger in addition to some other fun Windows Live features.</main>-->
